            <h2>About Fight Club</h2>
            <p>Fight Club is a place where people can register and fight each other. </p>
            <p class="para"> "Fight Club" isn't just a movie about brawling; it's a provocative exploration of modern masculinity, consumerism, and the insidious nature of societal pressures, where an unnamed office worker finds a twisted sense of belonging through an underground fight club led by the enigmatic Tyler Durden, ultimately unraveling into a chaotic rebellion against the very fabric of society.</p>
